## Code Explanation

The provided code is a sample implementation of the KT Knoxville Divergence indicator in MQL5. It includes necessary libraries and defines constants and global variables for buffer storage.

The `OnInit` function initializes the indicator by registering it and setting buffer sizes and indicator parameters. It also checks if the indicator is successfully registered.

The `OnDeinit` function handles the indicator deinitialization by unregistering the indicator.

The `OnCalculate` function calculates the indicator values and performs trading operations based on the identified divergences. It checks if trading is allowed and if there are calculated indicator values. If there are bullish or bearish divergences, it performs the corresponding trading operations.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may need to be modified to fit specific trading strategies or requirements.
